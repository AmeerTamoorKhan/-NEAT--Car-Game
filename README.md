# -NEAT--Car-Game

**************** Reinforcement Learning ****************

 Reinforcement Learning: NEAT used to train a car to avoid the obstacles
 
 
Pygame, [NEAT] NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies, and a lot of patience took me to make this work. üò¨

The algorithm is a combo of Neural Networks and Genetic algorithm, which allows the network to learn in achieving a certain goal. In this case, the goal is to avoid holes.

Input: Car Front Sensor.

Output: Car Move Left, Right, Rest.
